#summary How to run project software on a development computer.

= Configurations =

Check out hidden material from internal svn. Look at the config.properties.dev file. Rename it to config.properties and place it at your [home-dir]/.iFeed/config.properties. 

Change the hard coded ip-numbers to your own computers number. Try using 'localhost', this has been reported as being a source of error though. 

Also change the 'hibernate.vendor.generateDdl=false' setting to 'hibernate.vendor.generateDdl=true' initially at least - since the application would lack its tables otherwise. 

Set the environment property 'datasoure.connector' to either 'jndi' or 'direct' depending on desired method of accessing the db.

One way of setting the env-prop is to edit the file [LIFE_RAY_HOME]/[TOMCAT_HOME]/bin/setenv.bat (or .sh-file).

<code>
if exist "%CATALINA_HOME%/jre1.6.0_21/win" (
	if not "%JAVA_HOME%" == "" (
		set JAVA_HOME=
	)

	set "JRE_HOME=%CATALINA_HOME%/jre1.6.0_21/win"
)

set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Duser.timezone=Europe/Stockholm -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Ddatasource.connector=direct"
</code>

Notice the '-Ddatasource.connector=direct' text near the end of the file.
